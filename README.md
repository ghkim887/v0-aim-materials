# Aim Materials

Aim Materials is a physics-enforced machine learning platform that generates novel inorganic crystal materials and validates them using a first-principles pipeline.

Candidate structures are generated across multi-element composition spaces and evaluated through Density Functional Theory (DFT), including structure optimization, electronic ground-state verification, and elastic property calculations. The platform is designed for publication-grade provenance and transparent reporting.
